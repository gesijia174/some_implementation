A simple repository to do some ML implementation using python.

## Why the project is useful
This project is only a backup for my learning. BTW, I **don't guarantee** the correctness of source code, which is like SGD, I mean, totally stochastic!!! But it's really useful for me myself.

You have no help only if you search by yourself.
